## Quick Start

### step 1: environment
```angular2html
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate lam-rl

# if need to train critic model
git clone https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory.git
cd LLaMA-Factory
pip install -e ".[torch,metrics]" 
```

### step 2: prepare images and annotations
Download raw images from [https://box.nju.edu.cn/f/96ba5115bae24eaaa44e/](Seeclick page) and put it in `images/` and use your GPT-4o api(fill the TODO) to generate the labeled data, by running:
```angular2html
python3 data_preprocess/aitw.py
```

### step 3: prepare checkpoints
Download the checkpoints from [checkpoints/]
organize the files like this:
```angular2html
LAM-RL/
    data/
      aitw_anns/
    images/
      aitw_images/
    checkpoints/
      Auto-UI-Base/
      blip2-opt-2.7b/
      roberta-base/
      Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct/
      critic_1218/merge-520
      rl-1227/epoch_13
      critic_shopping/merge-
      rl-webshop/epoch_13
```

#### step 3: training the critic model
```angular2html
sh scripts/train_critic.sh
sh scripts/critic_merge.sh
```

### step 4: training the policy model
```angular2html
sh scripts/train_policy.sh
```

### step 5: eval
```angular2html
# offline eval
sh scripts/eval_policy.sh
# online eval, build the android env according to the DigiRL page, get the url and filling it to configs/online_eval.yaml
sh scripts/eval_online.sh
```
